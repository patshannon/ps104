Hi everyone!
  
I am currently focusing on <strong>React</strong> and other <strong>MERN</strong> stack frameworks. I have a love for design and I will be implementing great design into every project I build.  I am also learning how to build <strong>Webflow</strong> and <strong>Wordpress</strong> websites.  As I develop new skills I will continue to build new projects and improve existing ones.

Willing to collaborate on websites / web apps.

Cheers,
<br>
Pat
